# Risk assessments

This repository contains all risk assessments processed by Student Robotics
Southampton group from 2016 onwards.

To create a risk assessment using the template, copy the contents of
`example.tex` to a new file following the existing naming convention
(`YYYY/YYYYMMDD-ACTIVITY/YYYYMMDD-ACTIVITY.tex`) and fill in the fields in the
file. You can also check the source code of existing risk assessments for more
specific info.

## Union Southampton's risk assessment requirements

The Union require a risk assessment for our general day-to-day activities to be
submitted at least once per year. If this risk assessment is changed during the
year then the new copy should of course be re-submitted to the Union.

Additionally, they require a risk assessment for each event we run to be
submitted at least 3 weeks prior to the event.

Risk assessments are submitted by email to groups@unionsouthampton.org.

The Union provides a risk assessment template in DOCX format. Presumably, submitted
risk assessments should follow this template and also be in DOCX format.

More information about the Union's risk assessment procedure can be found on their
[website][susu-risk-assessments].
