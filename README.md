# Risk assessments

This repository contains all risk assessments processed by Student Robotics Southampton group from 2016 onwards.

## SUSU's risk assessment requirements

SUSU require a risk assessment for our general day-to-day activities to be submitted at least once per year. If this risk assessment is changed during the year then the new copy should of course be re-submitted to SUSU.

Additionally, they require a risk assessment for each event we run to be submitted at least 3 weeks prior to the event.

Risk assessments are submitted by email to groups@susu.org.

More information about SUSU's risk assessment procedure can be found on their [website][susu-risk-assessments].
