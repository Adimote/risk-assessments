\newcommand{\activitysummary}{
    The summer school is run by the ECS department with assistance from
    Student Robotics Southampton. The participants in the summer school are
    invited to design, build and test an autonomous robot in small teams. The
    robots must perform a simple task, usually involving locating and moving
    coloured boxes, which is performed competitively against other teams'
    robots.

    In addition to this main event, there are a number of taught laboratory
    sessions. Members of Student Robotics Southampton will mentor and provide assistance to
    the participants, as well as set up the arena for the competition and lead
    the laboratory sessions.

    This risk assessment specifically covers the use of the electronics and
    computing laboratories for taught lab sessions and robot
    building sessions. Manual and/or power tools will be used to assemble the
    robot chassis, and lithium polymer batteries may be used inside the robots.

    This document should be considered an extension of the general risk
    assessment for the summer school\footnote{Available at
    \url{http://dl.kierdavis.com/srobo-soton-risk-assessments/latest/20160801-summer-school.pdf}}.

    \subsection*{Risk of fire}

    To minimise the risk of fire resulting from this activity, food and drink
    will not be allowed near electrical equipment, and naked flames will be
    prohibited. The risk of fire occurring elsewhere in the building(s) is
    controlled primarily by the building operator\estatesfacilitiesfootnote.
    The ESO will ensure that all people present are informed of the locations of
    the exits and whether any fire drills are expected to take place.
    Should a fire break out (or any other event requiring evacuation), all
    people are to evacuate through the nearest accessible exit.
